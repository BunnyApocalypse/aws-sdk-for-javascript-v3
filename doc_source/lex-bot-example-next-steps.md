This topic is part of a tutorial that create an Amazon Lex chatbot within a web application to engage your web site visitor\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Building an Amazon Lex chatbot](lex-bot-example.md)\.

Congratulations\! You have created a Node\.js application that uses Amazon Lex to create an interactive user experience\. As stated at the beginning of this tutorial, be sure to terminate all of the resources you create while going through this tutorial to ensure that youâ€™re not charged\. You can do this by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack you created in the [Create the AWS resources ](scheduled-events-invoking-lambda-provision-resources.md) topic of this tutorial\.

 Instructions on how to modify the stack, or to delete the stack and its associated resources when you have finished the tutorial, see [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/resources/cdk#running-a-cdk-app)\.
