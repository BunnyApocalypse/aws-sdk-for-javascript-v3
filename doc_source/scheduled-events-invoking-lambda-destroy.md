# Delete the resources<a name="scheduled-events-invoking-lambda-destroy"></a>

This topic is part of a tutorial that demonstrates how to invoke a Lambda function through Amazon CloudWatch scheduled events using the AWS SDK for JavaScript\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Creating scheduled events to execute Lambda functions](scheduled-events-invoking-lambda-example.md)\.

When you finish the tutorial, you should delete the resources so you do not incur any unnecessary charges\. You can do this by deleting the AWS CloudFormation stack you created in the [Create the AWS resources ](scheduled-events-invoking-lambda-provision-resources.md) topic of this tutorial\.

 Instructions on how to modify the stack, or to delete the stack and its associated resources when you have finished the tutorial, see [here on GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/resources/cdk#running-a-cdk-app)\.
