# Getting started with the AWS SDK for JavaScript<a name="getting-started"></a>

The AWS SDK for JavaScript provides access to web services in either browser scripts or Node\.js\. This section has two getting started exercises that show you how to work with the SDK for JavaScript in each of these JavaScript environments\.

**Note**  
You can develop Node\.js applications, and Node\.js for browser\-based applications, using the SDK for JavaScript in the AWS Cloud9 IDE\. For an example of how to use AWS Cloud9 for Node\.js development, see [Using AWS Cloud9 with the AWS SDK for JavaScript](cloud9-javascript.md)\.
