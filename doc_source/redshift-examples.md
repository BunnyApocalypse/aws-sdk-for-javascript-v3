Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte\-scale data warehouse service in the cloud\. An Amazon Redshift data warehouse is a collection of computing resources called *nodes*, which are organized into a group called a *cluster*\. Each cluster runs an Amazon Redshift engine and contains one or more databases\.

The JavaScript API for Amazon Redshift is exposed through the [Redshift](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/Redshift.html) client class\.
